French Connection Technical Test


Task:
* A possible mock-up needs to be implemented by the Front End team using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* It needs to be responsive, standards compliant, coded cleanly and be pixel perfect.

Objectives:
* Spend no longer than two hours on the test.
* Complete as much as you can (doesn’t have to be completed fully).
* You are free to use a responsive framework/boilerplate, JavaScript task runner etc.
* Provide a .txt file of a complete list of what you used to complete the task, any issues encountered, any assumptions, improvements, time taken and what you would do next if you didn’t finish.
* Provide either a link to a Git repository or a zipped folder ensuring the page loads locally.

Instructions/Helpers:
* Font used is Arial, weights/sizes are purposely not given.
* All text is live text and shouldn’t be part of any imagery.
* The text in the top image (Men’s Essentials) should be hidden initially, then it should fade in slowly after 3 seconds of the page initially loading.
* All imagery should be clickable and should include the ‘Product Name Here £000’.
* The test should be fully responsive, if you run out of time, notes on how you will achieve this would help.
* No designs have been provided for Tablet/Mobile devices, how are you going to implement this?

Goals:
* Provide a responsive, standards compliant, cleanly coded, pixel perfect template.
* A .txt file with the information above.
* A link to a Git repository or a zipped folder containing the template and supporting files.
